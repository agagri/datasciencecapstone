The Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone project from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) allows students to create a usable public data product that can show their skills to potential employers. Projects are drawn from real-world problems and are conducted with industry, government, and academic partners. For this iteration of the class, JHU is partnering with SwiftKey (http://swiftkey.com/en/) to apply data science in the area of natural language processing.
